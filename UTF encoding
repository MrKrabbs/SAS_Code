7613832732: Mismatch in Column Length from SAS/Access to oracle

 

It seems to me that your SAS system is using UTF-8 encoding. To avoid possible data truncation, when SAS sees 100 number of characters (FULL_POOL_NAME) from Oracle, it allocates 400 bytes for it, because each character can use up to 4 bytes in UTF8 encoding. The "over allocation" can happen in both directions, from Oracle to SAS, or from SAS to Oracle.

 

If your data is all single byte characters, like English or LATIN-1, then you can use these libname options to force 1 byte per character behavior even SAS session is in multi-byte encoding like UTF-8. Here is the example:

 

libname x oracle path=... user=... pwd=... dbserver_max_bytes=1 dbclient_max_bytes=1;

 

This tells SAS to use 1 byte per character on database data, and SAS data. Please add these two options and give them a try to see if it resolves the issue, and let me know the result.
